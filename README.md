## 🚜 Core Capabilities

### 1. Live Fleet Telemetry
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor tractor movement with sub-second latency via Socket.io.
- **Boustrophedon Generation**: Intelligent simulator generates realistic lane-by-lane patterns for demo environments.
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Dynamic infection heatmaps that update in real-time based on CV detections.

### 2. RAG Agronomic Advisory
- **Grounded Advice**: AI recommendations are grounded in verified ICAR/KVK knowledge bases using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- **Primary Source Citations**: Every piece of advice includes direct links to supporting research or government circulars.
- **Trust UI**: A dedicated interface to verify the LLM's sources and reasoning.

### 3. Edge Computer Vision
- **Multi-Stage Pipeline**: YOLOv8n Leaf Segmentation → MobileNetV2 Classification → U-Net Lesion Mapping.
- **Targeted Spraying**: Detection data drives a 6-lane boom-sprayer control system for optimal chemical use.
